# Jet-Anamoly-Detection
## Project Overview
### High-energy collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) generate jets that contain crucial information about particle interactions. Detecting rare or anomalous jet events is challenging due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the data. This project applies machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify jet events and detect anomalies using both tabular jet features and image-like jet representations.

## Methodology
### 1.Exploratory Data Analysis  
### Correlation matrices  
### Target class distribution  
### Feature-wise statistical analysis
